Our work encompasses the first-order fragments of several existing categorical structures for differentiation, including cartesian differential categories, generalised cartesian differential categories, tangent categories, as well as the versions of these categories axiomatising reverse derivatives. We explain uniformly and concisely the requirements expressed by these structures, using sections of suitable fibrations as unifying concept. Our perspective sheds light on their similarities and differences, as well as simplifying certain constructions from the literature.< /p>"

   "abstract":"String diagrams are pictorial representations for morphisms of symmetric monoidal categories. They constitute an intuitive and expressive graphical syntax, which has found application in a very diverse range of fields including concurrency theory, quantum computing, control theory, machine learning, linguistics, and digital circuits. Rewriting theory for string diagrams relies on a combinatorial interpretation as double-pushout rewriting of certain hypergraphs. As previously studied, there is a `tension' in this interpretation: in order to make it sound and complete, we either need to add structure on string diagrams (in particular, Frobenius algebra structure) or pose restrictions on double-pushout rewriting (resulting in 'convex' rewriting). From the string diagram viewpoint, imposing a full Frobenius structure may not always be natural or desirable in applications, which motivates our study of a weaker requirement: commutative monoid structure. In this work we characterise string diagram rewriting modulo commutative monoid equations, via a sound and complete interpretation in a suitable notion of double-pushout rewriting of hypergraphs.< /p>"

Our main technical contribution is a complete axiomatisation for graphical affine algebra over these two interpretations. We also show, as case studies, how graphical affine algebra captures electrical circuits and the calculus of stateless connectors---a coordination language for distributed systems.< /p>"

     "abstract":"<p>Extracting causal relationships from observed correlations is a growing area in probabilistic reasoning, originating with the seminal work of Pearl and others from the early 1990s. This paper develops a new, categorically oriented view based on a clear distinction between syntax (string diagrams) and semantics (stochastic matrices), connected via interpretations as structure-preserving functors. A key notion in the identification of causal effects is that of an intervention, whereby a variable is forcefully set to a particular value independent of any prior propensities. We represent the effect of such an intervention as an endofunctor which performs ‚Äòstring diagram surgery‚Äô within the syntactic category of string diagrams. This diagram surgery in turn yields a new, interventional distribution via the interpretation functor. While in general there is no way to compute interventional distributions purely from observed data, we show that this is possible in certain special cases using a calculational tool called comb disintegration. We demonstrate the use of this technique on a well-known toy example, where we predict the causal effect of smoking on cancer in the presence of a confounding common cause. After developing this specific example, we show this technique provides simple sufficient conditions for computing interventions which apply to a wide variety of situations considered in the causal inference literature.< /p>"

Significantly, it uses the same syntax and operational semantics as the signal flow calculus ‚Äî an algebraic formalism for signal flow graphs, which is a combinatorial model of computation of interest in control theory. Indeed, our approach stems from the simple but fruitful realisation that, by replacing real numbers (modelling signals) with natural numbers (modelling resources) in the operational semantics, concurrent behaviour patterns emerge. The resource calculus is canonical: we equip it and its stateful extension with equational theories that characterise the underlying space of definable behaviours‚Äîa convex algebraic universe of additive relations‚Äî via isomorphisms of categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our calculus is sufficiently expressive to capture behaviour definable by classical Petri nets.< /p>"

As with previous Kleene Algebra extensions, developing a correspondence between denotational and operational perspectives is important, for both foundations and applications. This paper takes an important step towards this, by precisely relating bi-Kleene Algebra (BKA), a relaxed version of CKA, to a novel type of automata called pomset automata. We show that pomset automata can faithfully represent the BKA-semantics of series-parallel rational expressions, and that a (structurally restricted) class of pomset automata can be translated back to these expressions. Furthermore, we characterise the behavior of general pomset automata in terms of context-free pomset grammars, thus yielding strong undecidability results.< /p>"

In this paper we show how semantic categories of both relations and corelations can be characterised as colimits of simpler categories. This modular perspective is important as it simplifies the task of giving a complete axiomatisation for semantic equivalence of string diagrams.

     "abstract":"<p>Symmetric monoidal categories have become ubiquitous as a formal environment for the analysis of compound systems in a compositional, resource-sensitive manner using the graphical syntax of string diagrams. Recently, reasoning with string diagrams has been implemented concretely via double-pushout (DPO) hypergraph rewriting. The hypergraph representation has the twin advantages of being convenient for mechanisation and of completely absorbing the structural laws of symmetric monoidal categories, leaving just the domain-specific equations explicit in the rewriting system. In many applications across different disciplines (linguistics, concurrency, quantum computation, control theory, ...) the structural component appears to be richer than just the symmetric monoidal structure, as it includes one or more Frobenius algebras. In this work we develop a DPO rewriting formalism which is able to absorb multiple Frobenius structures, thus sensibly simplifying diagrammatic reasoning in the aforementioned applications. As a proof of concept, we use our formalism to describe an algorithm which computes the reduced form of a diagram of the theory of interacting bialgebras using a simple rewrite strategy.< /p>"

Examples include electrical circuits, signal flow graphs, Penrose and Feynman diagrams, Bayesian networks, Petri nets, Kahn process networks, proof nets, UML specifications, amongst many others. Graphical languages provide a convenient abstraction of some underlying mathematical formalism, which gives meaning to diagrams. For instance, signal flow graphs, foundational structures in control theory, are traditionally translated into systems of linear equations. This is typical: diagrammatic languages are used as an interface for more traditional mathematics, but rarely studied per se.Recent trends in computer science analyse diagrams as first - class objects using formal methods from programming language semantics.In many such approaches, diagrams are generated as the arrows of a PROP‚Äî a special kind of monoidal category‚Äî by a two - dimensional syntax and equations.The domain of interpretation of diagrams is also formalised as a PROP and the(compositional) semantics is expressed as a functor preserving the PROP structure.The first main contribution of this thesis is the characterisation of SVk, the PROP of linear subspaces over a field k.This is an important domain of interpretation for diagrams appearing in diverse research areas, like the signal flow graphs mentioned above.We present by generators and equations the PROP IH of string diagrams whose free model is SVk.The name IH stands for interacting Hopf algebras: indeed, the equations of IH arise by distributive laws between Hopf algebras, which we obtain using Lack‚Äô s technique for composing PROPs.The significance of the result is two - fold.On the one hand, it offers a canonical string diagrammatic syntax for linear algebra: linear maps, kernels, subspaces and the standard linear algebraic transformations are all faithfully represented in the graphical language.On the other hand, the equations of IH describe familiar algebraic structures‚Äî Hopf algebras and Frobenius algebras‚Äî which are at the heart of graphical formalisms as seemingly diverse as quantum circuits, signal flow graphs, simple electrical circuits and Petri nets.Our characterisation enlightens the provenance of these axioms and reveals their linear algebraic nature.Our second main contribution is an application of IH to the semantics of signal processing circuits.We develop a formal theory of signal flow graphs, featuring a string diagrammatic syntax for circuits, a structural operational semantics and a denotational semantics.We prove soundness and completeness of the equations of IH for denotational equivalence.Also, we study the full abstraction question: it turns out that the purely operational picture is too concrete‚Äî two graphs that are denotationally equal may exhibit different operational behaviour.We classify the ways in which this can occur and show that any graph can be realised‚Äî rewritten, using the equations of IH, into an executable form where the operational behaviour and the denotation coincide.This realisability theorem‚Äî which is the culmination of our developments‚Äî suggests a reflection about the role of causality in the semantics of signal flow graphs and, more generally, of computing devices. < /p>",

In this approach, signal flow graphs are given a relational denotational semantics in terms of formal power series. Thus far, the operational behaviour of such signal flow graphs has only been discussed at an intuitive level. In this paper we equip them with a structural operational semantics. As is typically the case, the purely operational picture is too concrete ‚Äì two graphs that are denotationally equal may exhibit different operational behaviour.

Such theories feature in many fields: e.g. quantum computing, compositional semantics of concurrency, network algebra and component-based programming. In this paper we study an important sub-theory of Coecke and Duncan‚Äôs ZX-calculus, related to strongly-complementary observables, where two Frobenius algebras interact. We characterize its free model as a category of ‚Ñ§2-vector subspaces. Moreover, we use the framework of PROPs to exhibit the modular structure of its algebra via a universal construction involving span and cospan categories of ‚Ñ§2-matrices and distributive laws between PROPs. Our approach demonstrates that the Frobenius structures result from the interaction of bialgebras. </p>"

This allows to consider a wide range of other examples, including Mazurkiewicz traces for concurrent systems.</p>"

This semantics fails to be compositional, in the sense that the coalgebra formalizing such behavior does not commute with the substitutions that may apply to a goal. We suggest that this is an instance of a more general phenomenon, occurring in the setting of interactive systems (in particular, nominal process calculi), when one tries to model their semantics with coalgebrae on presheaves. In those cases, compositionality can be obtained through saturation. We apply the same approach to logic programming: the resulting semantics is compositional and enjoys an elegant formulation in terms of coalgebrae on presheaves and their right Kan extensions.</p>"

For this purpose we introduce a variant of standard monadic second-order logic (MSO), which we call well-founded monadic second-order logic (WFMSO). When interpreted in a tree model, the second-order quantifiers of WFMSO range over subsets of conversely well-founded subtrees. The first main result of the paper states that the expressive power of WFMSO over trees exactly corresponds to that of weak MSO-automata. Using this automata-theoretic characterization, we then show that, over the class of all transition structures, the bisimulation-invariant fragment of WFMSO is the alternation-free fragment of the modal Œº-calculus. As a corollary, we find that the logics WFMSO and WMSO (weak monadic second-order logic, where second-order quantification concerns finite subsets), are incomparable in expressive power.</p>"

     "abstract":"<p>In this thesis we study the expressive power of variants of monadic second-order logic (MSO) on infinite trees by means of automata.In particular we are interested in weak MSO and well-founded MSO, where the second-order quantifiers range respectively over finite sets and over subsets of well-founded trees. On finitely branching trees, weak and well-founded MSO have the same expressive power and are both strictly weaker than MSO.The associated class of automata(called weak MSO - automata) is a restriction of the class characterizing MSO-expressivity. We show that, on trees with arbitrary branching degree, weak MSO-automata characterize the expressive power of well-founded MSO, which turns out to be incomparable with weak MSO. Indeed, in this generalized setting, weak MSO gives an account of properties of the‚Äò horizontal dimension‚Äô of trees, which cannot be described by means of MSO or well-founded MSO formulae. In analogy with the result of Janin and Walukiewicz for MSO and the modal ¬µ-calculus, this raises the issue of which modal logic captures the bisimulation-invariant fragment of well-founded MSO and weak MSO.We show that the alternation-free fragment of the modal ¬µ-calculus and the bisimulation-invariant fragment of well-founded MSO have the same expressive power on trees of arbitrary branching degree.We motivate the conjecture that weak MSO modulo bisimulation collapses inside MSO and well-founded MSO. < /p>",
