<h1>Compositional Methods for Network Diagrams and Component-Based Systems</h1>
<h3>Bellairs Reseach Institute, Barbados, 18th to 22nd March 2018 (+ Excursion on 17th March)</h3>

<p> This edition of the Bellairs workshop series will bring together scientists whose work in diverse fields (including quantum theory, control theory, concurrency, circuit theory, database theory, Bayesian probability and natural language processing) takes place within a common mathematical framework, based on monoidal category theory and inspired by programming language semantics. </p>

  A <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/Bellairs/18/wshop18.html">workshop on Logical Foundations for Data Science</a> will run in parallel at the same venue, with organizers <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Eprakash">
Prakash Panangaden</a> and <a href="http://www.alexandrasilva.org/">Alexandra
Silva.</a> </p>

<h4> Workshop Structure </h4>

<p>The workshop will be held from 18th March (Sunday) to 22nd March 2018 (Thursday) at the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/bellairs/">Bellairs
Research Institute</a> on the island of Barbados, owned and operated by McGill University. Saturday 17 will be devoted to a one-day excursion.
  The practice at these workshops has been to allow the speaker ample time
  to get to technical details.  There should be lots of opportunities for
  extensive small group discussions; we will not cram the schedule with lots
  of short talks.  The talks are given on primitive chalkboards.  Please do
  not prepare slides for a data projector or plastic transparencies.

<h4> Travel Information</h4>

<p> The airport is on the east-south point of the island and Bellairs is
on the west side in the Parish of St. James (about a 40 minute taxi
drive).</p>

<p> <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/Bellairs/18/barbados.gif"> Here is a map of Barbados</a>.  Tell the taxi
drivers to take you to <b>Bellairs Research Centre in Holetown.</b>
Holetown is small and Bellairs is on the main street - it is just
north of Folkstone Park.  When filling in the Immigration form at the
airport give the address as Bellairs Research Institute, Holetown, Parish of
St. James.  The taxi ride should cost about $35- $45 U.S.  Barbados is safe
and one shouldn't worry about travelling alone during the day.  US currency
is freely accepted at 2 Barbadian dollars per US dollar.  Other currencies
(Pound sterling, Canadian dollars) are not accepted; you will have to
change them at banks or at the airport.&nbsp; Some people had trouble using
their bank cards from Europe, but Canadian and US cards seem to work fine.
At the airport if you go around to the departures side just after you
arrive you will find cash machines there; strangely there are no ATMs at
the arrivals area. </p>

<p>Good things to bring are suntan lotion or dark skin, mosquito repellent,
swimwear, papers/books/stationary and light clothing (it will be pleasantly
warm).
There is wireless hookup for laptops so you can bring your own laptop.
There will be a workshop fee of US $100 to cover administrative costs. The
cost of a room will vary, but should be approximately between $35 and $50.  Dinners will be served on site for
US $25 per meal and breakfasts for US $8 per meal.  Payment can be made by
credit card.  The room allocations are made by the organizers, please do
not contact the Bellairs staff to make room bookings.</p>
