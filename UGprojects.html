 <p> I am available to supervise the following projects, at the BSc, MSc or MEng level, depending on the student's preparation. An essential prerequisite for any of these projects is an interest for mathematical theory of computation--- in particular formal languages, algebra and logic. You are welcome to contact me by email for further information/expressions of interest. </p>

                    <h3>Learning Algorithms for Signal Flow Graphs </h3>
                <p>Signal flow graphs are a well established family of signal processing circuits that play a foundational role in Control Theory. One intriguing aspect of the mathematics underpinning these structures is that they can be explained in terms of equivalent, yet seemingly diverse computational models, including rational stream functions and weighted automata. This project aims at exploiting the correspondence with weighted automata to study signal flow graphs with automata-theoretic methods. The focus will be on learning, a technique that allows to synthesise an automaton recognising a certain language just by observing its behaviour or response to certain queries. Does the learning algorithm translate to a signal flow graph synthesis procedure in an interesting way? As signal flow graphs translate to particularly simple weighted automata (on a singleton alphabet), does the learning algorithm simplify too? Does it have a better complexity bound than for arbitrary weighted automata?

We will try to investigate these questions based on recent works that formulate both the theory of signal flow graphs and of automata learning in the abstract language of categorical algebra and coalgebra:

 <h3>A Compiler for String Diagrams </h3>
<p>String Diagrams are a graphical formal language. They find mathematical justification in a branch of abstract algebra called Category Theory, but they also have very practical utility: in the last few years, string diagrams have been used to model and analyse dynamical systems in various fields, including concurrency, control, and quantum theory.

String diagrams may be specified in different ways. For humans, the graphical way is the most convenient: a string diagram can be written as some sort of graph, with boxes and wries. However, formally each such diagram corresponds to a certain string, describing an arrow of a monoidal category. Swtiching from a diagram to the corresponding arrow and back may be tricky, as this correspondence is not 1-1: the same diagram may be written textually as different (yet equivalent) strings!

The goal of this project is to write a tool that allows to specify a string diagram, either graphically or textually, and compile into the other representation. Along the way, the student will learn some basics of category theory and the applications of string diagrams in Computer Science.
